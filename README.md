The above listed codes and information are unique and it is open source to use.

We predict the Damage level to the buildings, organizations, Houses, and Apartments by considering the main attributes like Magnitude level, latitude, and longitude.

We give the damage level in three ways,

  ðŸ‘‰ low-level damage

  ðŸ‘‰Medium level damage

  ðŸ‘‰Complete destruction.

We predict the level by using algorithms like 

  1. Decision tree

  2. Random forest using Python.

As we are a Data Science stream we visualized the output using data analytics tools like PoweBI to impress our eyes nicely and visible the output clear and flexible.

I attached the "POWER BI" Visualization
