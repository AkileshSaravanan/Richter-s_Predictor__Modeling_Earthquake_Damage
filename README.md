The above listed codes and information are unique and it is open source to use.

We predict the Damage level to the buildings,organizations,Houses and Apartments by considering the main attributes like Magnitude level,latitude and longitude.

We give the damage level by three ways are,

  ðŸ‘‰low level damage

  ðŸ‘‰Medium level damage

  ðŸ‘‰Complete destruction.

We use to predict the level by using the algorithms like 

  1.Desicion tree

  2.Random forest

  3.Xgboost by using python.

As we are Data Science stream so we visualized the output using data analytics tool like PoweBI to impress our eyes nicely and visible the output clearly and flexibly.

I attached the "POWER BI" Visualization
